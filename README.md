# ForthwithEx

WIP: still working heavily on this. I hope to release a `iex_ssh_shell` customized for making quick and easy TUI prompts. 

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `forthwith_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:forthwith_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/forthwith_ex](https://hexdocs.pm/forthwith_ex).
